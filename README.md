# Course
Recommendation System

**Skills and Tools Covered:**

* Rank-Based Recommendation System
* Similarity-based Recommendation system
* Matrix factorization based Recommendation system

# Business Problem and Data Overview
Amazon has given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. A collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products is given. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.

**Dataset**

The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:

*  **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id
*  **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id
*  **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user
*  **timestamp:** Time of the rating. We will not use this column to solve the current problem
